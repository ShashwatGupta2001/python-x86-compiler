**About Late Submission**
1) Personal Involvements (till 3rd march)
a) Akshat Gupta

    -> UGP Work (May increase with time)
    -> Major workload will start peaking after midsem
b) Devansh Kumar Jha
    -> Midsem (18 feb - 24 feb everyday)
    -> 4 quizzes before midsem (2nd feb, 5th feb, 10th feb, 14th feb)
    -> 4 assignments before midsem (Minor - EE301*1, EE311*1, Major - EE360*1, CS335*1)
    -> Can't give dedicated time throughout
c) Shashwat Gupta

2) We have 3 milestones and 4 free days (with day gradularity**)
    -> 1st milestone (till 3rd march)

    -> Usage
        -> Obviously the last month of the semester will be the most vulnerable
