################################### CODE OF CONDUCT ######################################

1) Print statements
    -> Are required for implementing the --verbose feature.
    -> [lexer] [parser] -> To be annotated on every error statement.
    -> Print all the errors at the topmost level by appending them in a string.
2) Comments in the code
    -> Every specification (code, flex, bison) has a way of writing Comments

**Common Coding Practises to follow**
    -> Related to Debugging of Code
        -> Make a boolean to setup debug outputs
            -> bool DEBUG_MODE = true;
        -> Use capital lettered identifier for debug output
            -> [LEXER], [PARSER], [OPTIMIZER], [GENERATOR] for all debug outputs
    -> For definition section
        -> The names of the defined regular patterns should be in lowercase english letters and may contain only underscore and digits apart from that.
    -> Other rules
        -> No use of "std::" in code. We will mention "using namespace std" at the top.
        -> isPyFile in top section for checking extension of the program.
        -> Use yylineno for counting lines no extra functions.
    -> Usage of data structures
        -> All data structures to be used will be pre-decided before starting work.
        -> lexemeMap and lexemeCount is used for lexer.
            -> map<string,string> lexemeMap;
            -> map<string,int> lexemeCount;
    -> Related to extra features to be implemented later on
        -> Will formulate as and when needed.
