How to handle rids

Changed /r to newline



"devansh.log"


-> Also replaced openingbraces and closingbraces
So will have to check the code of what is returned when we return in case of wrong closing bracket

        ==> This works atleast correctly for linux. Check whether it works on MacOS.
            -> You may need to add execute permissions for the program files which give error. Last step may require admin permissions.

DEBUGGING 3AC
================================================


Assumptions:
1. Only range iterator is provided as special iterator
2. print() is not allowed
3. Function defined below is not allowed to be called below
4. only single subscript allowed (no slicing) so it multiple will be dumped together
5. all colon cases in subscript are not allowed
6. No direct inputs from other files
7. Assuming that all files have __name__ == "__main__" dunders


Done:
1. All productions added
2. Delete unnecessary calls to newTemp() and newLabel()
1. .L
2. $t
3. call,_1
4. func up and down
4. """ newlines
6. hardcode __name__ and __main__ dunders


LEFT:
1. name mangling -> devansh + 
2. labels mapping -> devansh
3. tfpdef ->
4. remove removelines, and trailing etc functions
5. clerar n2c and k2n
6. sequential code -> try to do away as nexts
7. evalbool + .name in class
8. Additional return out of function in else
9. Remove empty gotos
10. Remove newlines and filter functions cause issues with multiline strings
11. a=b+c, add spaces everywhere
12. funcdef.2
13. factor.1/2/3/4
14. len(array)
